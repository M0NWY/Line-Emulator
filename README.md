# Line-Emulator
I wanted a thing that would let me connect two modems together, so I could connect my dreamcast to the internet. 
In 2020.
This is the result. It is also a dedicated hotline / intercom thing. Will work with most old analogue phones.
Includes an emulated dial tone with a delay before ringing the other line, standard uk ringing cadence and a timeout if the other line does not answer.
